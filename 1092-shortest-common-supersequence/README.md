# 1092. Shortest Common Supersequence 

**Difficulty:** Hard
**Topics:** String, Dynamic Programming, Longest Common Subsequence
**Link:** [https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-common-supersequence/](https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-common-supersequence/)

## Problem

Given two strings `str1` and `str2`, return *the shortest string that has both *`str1`* and *`str2`* as **subsequences***. If there are multiple valid strings, return **any** of them.

A string `s` is a **subsequence** of string `t` if deleting some number of characters from `t` (possibly `0`) results in the string `s`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: str1 = "abac", str2 = "cab"
Output: "cabac"
Explanation: 
str1 = "abac" is a subsequence of "cabac" because we can delete the first "c".
str2 = "cab" is a subsequence of "cabac" because we can delete the last "ac".
The answer provided is the shortest such string that satisfies these properties.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: str1 = "aaaaaaaa", str2 = "aaaaaaaa"
Output: "aaaaaaaa"
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= str1.length, str2.length <= 1000`
- `str1` and `str2` consist of lowercase English letters.

## Solution

- **Language:** Java
- **Runtime:** 22 ms
- **Memory:** 53.8 MB
